I have reviewed this article - https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/set-up-git

This article outlines all the steps needed to install Git and register in to GitHub from Git. The following concepts are covered in the article:

Using Git: how to install Git on your computer so that you can access it through the command line or GitHub Desktop.
The installation and configuration of Git, setting your login and commit email address
Git to GitHub authentication: HTTPS or SSH approaches to GitHub authentication

One aspect of the lesson that "works" is that it contains comprehensive guidance for installing Git and signing in to GitHub from within Git, including how to cache your GitHub login information in Git and create SSH keys.

The tutorial's assumption of prior understanding of fundamental Git commands and ideas, such as cloning or forking a repository, is one aspect that doesn't function. For those who are unfamiliar with Git, any further details or links would be beneficial.

Overall, I learned many things from this article.
